help.content=Welcome to Island Survivors, I hope you enjoy your stay on this small island.\n Maybe a few tips will help you.\n 1.To start, all you have to do is move and to do so, just touch the screen and swipe towards where you want to move.\n You will see that there are some strange creatures that run towards you for no apparent reason, although some of them may look cute they don't come to give you hugs so \nRUUUN!\n2.Relax, luckily you are an expert archer and even if it takes you some time to aim and run you will be able to do it without any problem,\n It's like it comes naturally to you, you'd almost say it's automatic, so don't worry about pointing or anything like that.\n 3. If you manage to eliminate one of these malevolent creatures you will get some experience,\n each enemy drops an experience item when dying although its value depends on the enemy eliminated.\n On rare occasions you will get a small bag of gold that serves to increase your score at the end of the game.\n and on more rare occasions a piece of meat with which you will heal a little bit of life.\n 4.If you manage to fill the experience bar you will level up.\n When leveling up you can choose between 3 different random upgrades that will improve your character.\nIf you manage to hold on for a very long 8 minutes, the game is over,\n calculating your final score and if you're lucky your score record\n will be saved in the records section.\n
